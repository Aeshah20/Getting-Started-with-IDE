Write code to add two arrays using Numpy library.

Note: Since the library is already installed in the practice, there is no need to install it again.

1- Import the numpy library, create two numpy arrays, and add them.
2- import numpy as np

a = np.array([2,3,4])
b = np.array([3,2,1])
c = a + b
print (c)

3. Run the program.
cd software101
python3.11 software.py

4. Edit the software.py file and change one of the arrays.
Change the array ‘a’ to [5,3,1] and save the file.

5.Run the updated file.
Run the program in the terminal using the below command:
python3.11 software.py
